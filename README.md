# Pands Weekly Tasks

Author: Irene Kilgannon

This respository contains the weekly tasks assignments for the module, Programming and Scripting for the H. Dip in Science in Data Analytics, Atlantic Technological University.

The overall aim of programming and scripting module is to teach the basics of Python programming.

Eight tasks were assigned and each task was written in python using VScode. Some of the trickier assignments, that required additional comments have an associated Jupyter notebook ,as shown in the table below.

## Description of each task and references.


__Week 1 helloworld.py__

Write a program that prints Hello World!

__Week 3 accounts.py__

Read in a 10 character bank account number and outputs the account number displaying the last 4 digits showing and the first 6 digits replaced with X's.

Extra: Modify the program to deal with an account number of any length.

[Python strings](https://realpython.com/python-strings/) The sections on string indexing, string slicing and modifying strings were particularily useful.

__Week 4  collatz.py__

Based on the Collatz Conjecture. Asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the following: if number is even, divide by 2, if number is odd, multiply x 3 and add 1. Have the program end when value is 1.
